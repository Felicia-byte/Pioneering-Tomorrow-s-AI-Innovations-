# Smart Agriculture System — AI + IoT (1-page proposal)

Project title: CropSense — AI-driven Smart Agriculture for Yield Optimization

Problem statement
Small and medium farms often lack precise, timely insight into microclimates, soil health, and localized pest pressure; this leads to suboptimal irrigation, fertilization, and pest control decisions that reduce yield and waste water and fertilizer.

Solution overview
CropSense combines a distributed IoT sensor network, edge compute at field gateways, satellite/Drone imagery, and cloud-based model training to provide per-plot short-term (7–30 day) yield forecasts and actionable recommendations (irrigation schedule, nutrient adjustments, pest alerts).

Sensors & hardware (minimum viable set)
- Soil moisture sensors (capacitive) at multiple depths
- Soil temperature sensors
- Ambient air temperature & humidity sensor
- PAR / light sensor (photosynthetically active radiation)
- EC (electrical conductivity) sensor for soil salinity
- NDVI-capable multispectral camera on periodic drone or fixed near-field mast
- Weather station (rain gauge, wind speed/direction)
- Edge gateway (Raspberry Pi 4 or comparable) with LoRaWAN/4G connectivity

AI model proposal
- Model type: fusion model combining temporal and spatial features. Core model: Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) or LSTM for time-series sensor data + small CNN for processed multispectral imagery; final fusion via gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost) or a shallow dense network for tabular + embedding features.
- Inputs: time series of soil moisture, temperature, humidity, recent irrigation logs, fertilizer application events, multispectral indices (NDVI, NDRE), weather forecasts (GFS/METAR), crop calendar metadata.
- Output: per-plot yield estimate (continuous), irrigation recommendation (categorical/continuous), pest risk score (probability). Also provide uncertainty intervals.

Data flow (high-level)
1. Sensors -> edge gateway (local aggregation, light preprocessing, compression).\n2. Edge gateway -> cloud (periodic sync; only aggregates & anonymized features; threshold alerts sent immediately).\n3. Cloud training: centralized model retraining with aggregated farm data + public datasets (satellite/weather).\n4. Model updates -> Edge gateways (delta update).\n5. Dashboard & mobile app for farmer recommendations and visualization.

Key benefits
- Reduced water/fertilizer use via precise irrigation.\n- Improved yield forecasting for market planning.\n- Reduced labor through automated alerts and prioritization.

Risks & mitigations
- Data gaps: use imputation and satellite fallback.\n- Privacy: anonymize farm IDs and share opt-in aggregated models.\n- Model drift: schedule periodic retraining and local validation.

Next steps (MVP)
- Pilot on 3 plots with sensors + monthly drone imagery.\n- Collect 3 months of sensor data, build baseline model, measure irrigation savings and forecast accuracy.
