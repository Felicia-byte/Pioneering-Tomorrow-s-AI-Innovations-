# Elevator Pitch Deck — CropSense / Pioneering Tomorrow's AI Innovations

Slide 1 — Title
- Project: CropSense — AI-driven Smart Agriculture
- Tagline: Precise, fair, and low-power crop yield optimization at the edge
- Team & contact

Slide 2 — Problem
- Small/medium farms face uncertain yields, water waste, and delayed pest detection.
- Market size and pain (wasted inputs, lost revenue).

Slide 3 — Solution
- Overview of CropSense (sensors + edge gateways + cloud ML + farmer dashboard).
- Key features: yield forecasting, irrigation optimization, pest alerts.

Slide 4 — Technology
- Lightweight edge models (TFLite), sensor fusion ML (TCN + CNN + XGBoost), cloud retraining, secure OTA model updates.
- Prototype deliverables: trained model, TFLite conversion, Pi deployment guide.

Slide 5 — Impact & Metrics
- Expected KPIs: % water saved, % yield improvement, forecast RMSE.
- Social impact: resource efficiency, small-farm resilience.

Slide 6 — Roadmap
- 0–3 months: pilot sensors on 3 plots; collect data.\n- 3–9 months: model training, iterative deployment.\n- 9–18 months: scale and integrate marketplace/aggregation.

Slide 7 — Business/Go-to-market
- Pricing: subscription + hardware bundle or partnership with cooperatives.\n- Partners: ag extension services, local NGOs.

Slide 8 — Ask & Next Steps
- Pilot partners, dataset access, or seed funding.\n- Demo instructions & contact info.
