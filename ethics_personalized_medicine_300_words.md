Biases and fairness strategies when using TCGA for AI-driven treatment recommendations

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a rich resource for genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical tumor data, but relying on it for AI-driven treatment recommendations risks embedding several biases. First, cohort representation varies by cancer type, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status: TCGA cohorts are enriched for certain populations and clinical centers, which can produce models that underperform for underrepresented ancestral groups or rare tumor subtypes. Second, clinical heterogeneity and treatment protocols in TCGA reflect historical practice patterns; models trained on these data may reproduce outdated or context-specific treatment choices rather than optimal, current standards. Third, sampling and measurement biases (batch effects across sequencing centers, different library prep methods) can create spurious associations that models exploit, reducing generalizability.

To mitigate these risks, adopt a multi-pronged fairness strategy. Data diversification is essential: curate additional datasets that increase representation across ancestries, geographies, and clinical settings (including community hospitals). Use federated learning to incorporate models trained on local hospital data where privacy or governance prevents data sharing — this reduces central dataset bias while maintaining patient privacy. Apply rigorous pre-processing: correct batch effects with domain-adaptation techniques and normalize features using clinically informed pipelines. During model development, incorporate fairness-aware objectives and constraint methods (e.g., equalized odds, group calibration) and evaluate performance stratified by demographic and clinical subgroups (ancestry, age, sex, tumor subtype). Provide uncertainty estimates and decision thresholds that vary by subgroup if needed, and require human-in-the-loop review for high-stakes recommendations.

Finally, governance and continuous monitoring are critical. Deploy models in controlled pilots with prospective validation and feedback loops that capture outcomes across subgroups; maintain audit logs and enable post-deployment recalibration. Engage diverse stakeholders — clinicians, patient advocates, ethicists — in dataset selection and evaluation criteria. Together, these steps reduce the risk of perpetuating health disparities while enabling responsible, equitable use of TCGA-powered AI in personalized medicine.
